General repository for the work "Computational loop reconstruction based design of efficient PET hydrolases" .

The "Computed Binding Geometries with Crystal Structures" folder contains the PET binding geometries of the wild-type Bhr-PETase and variant Bhr-NMT crystal structures, derived from PRODA's computational results.

In the "Modeller" folder, 50 remodeled structures were designed using Modeller.

In the "PRODA results" folder, the files in the 7EOA directory represent variants designed using the Bhr-PETase crystal structure (PDB ID: 7EOA) as a template, and the files in the Loop10 directory represent mutants designed with the remodeled Loop10 structure as a template. All enzyme-PET complex structures were derived from the computational results of PRODA, and used as initial conformations for MD simulations.

Moreover, other data, scripts or structures associated to this work will be available upon request to the author (zhuys@mail.buct.edu.cn).
